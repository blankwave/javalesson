|1| WAP to take n input for an array from user and display their average (use recursive function). Count odd and even number in that array.
|2| WAP to input name, age and height from user and pass it in function and print their name, age and height.
    WAP to take age as radius from the user. Pass radius as argument and find out the area and circuference of the circle using function.
|3| WAP to print out the sum, substraction, multiplication, division and remainder from these array using void function.
    Write this program in a single class.
    arrar1 = {1,3,5,7,9};
    arrar2 = {4,8,5,6,3};
    arrar3 = {8,9,6,7,2};
    arrar4 = {1,4,7,5,6};
    arrar5 = {9,8,5,3,0};
    [Hint: pass array1 and array2 first time, then array2 and array3 until you pass array4 and array5.]
    Example sum of array1 and array2.
    {1,3,5,7,9}+{1,3,5,7,9}={1+4,3+8,5+5,7+6,9+3}={5,11,10,13,12}
|4| WAP to input 3 word from user. Use function to get the length of each word. Use function to find the greatest, smallest, average of those length.
    Also create a 2d array with first word length value as number of colum and second word length value as number of rows. And Print that array.
    Write this program in a single class.
|5| WAP to create int, string, char, boolean and float 2d array.
    int 2d array of 2x3
    string 2d array of 3x2
    char 2d array of 3x3
    boolean 2d array of 2x2
    float 2d array of 4x3
    And print the value of those array.
